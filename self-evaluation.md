## Self Eval ##
---
**How Confident do you feel with the content so far?**
I feel pretty confident, all except when it comes to how to address booleans with arrays. My class mates helped me to write them, which helped simplify it but it does infact still boggle me a little.

**Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving on to the next lesson?**
Not really, I know we will tackle where we need to go next in the next assignment. 

**What questions do you have about Arrays?**
I would like to know how an array of booleans functions and how to access them.
