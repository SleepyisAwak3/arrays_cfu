// "".length" is a Javascript method that runs through all the elements in an array. However in this line,
// it only prints out the amount of elements in the array when ran.
var names = ["John", "V", "Judy", "Panamn"]
 console.log(names.length)

// ".pop()" Method is when the console access the last number, gets rid of it, and then returns it as the output we see.
 var numbers = [12, 4, 20, 51]
  console.log(numbers.pop(4))

// ".reverse()" Method prints out the array we have, but in the reverse order.
  var boos = [true, false, true, false]
  console.log(boos.reverse())

// The index file position is just of that as counting with a number line. 
// It starts with 0 as it does infact have value, and then counts up from there. So regularly it would go 1,2,3,4; however
// it goes 0,1,2,3... 

var example = [4, 5, 2, 8]
 console.log(example[3])
 console.log(example[0])
 console.log(example[2])
// With in the example code above you can see that the pink square brackets are going to print out the numbers 8,4, and 2.
// As those are where the elements lie in the index positioning.
